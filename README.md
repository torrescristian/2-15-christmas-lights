## Description

The Christmas Lights application relies on your development talents to create a mesmerizing light display. Your task is to draw seven colored circles in a row and based on a timer change the intensity of each circle. When a circle is brightened its predecessor returns to its normal intensity.

This simulates the effect of a string of rippling lights, similar to the ones displayed during the Christmas Holidays.
